        "wivive-des-2": "Evidence of the mounting cost of the Anthropocene surrounds us. Recent estimates suggest that one-fift of countries across the world are at risk of ecosystem collapse owing to the destruction of wildlife and habitats. The wider implications and costs of ecosystem degradation has also been brought into stark relief by the global Covid-19 pandemic. Yet many populations still lack access to basic services, such as water, with social, economic and environmental implications. CATALYST is an ambitious, short-duration, project that is intended to advance understanding and capabilities across the nexus of water-food and resilience. Our vision is to strengthen the capacity for impactful research which promotes the resilience of societies in LMICs to positively navigate major systemic shocks. Through our focus on water and food systems we aim to actively build knowledge that stimulates novel solutions to delivering Sustainable Development Goals at scale. CATALYST lays the foundations for a credible and respected global network of closely-integrated institutions working towards shared ambitions. Our principal objective is to addresses key socio-economic and environmental challenges in (urban) water management and the interconnection of human, animal and environmental health and wellbeing. Led by local partners, CATALYST focuses initially on research in Brazil, Eastern Africa and Vietnam, addressing identified local needs. In doing so CATALYST contributes to the UKâ€™s GCRF priority areas of clean air, water and sanitation (Equitable Access to Sustainable Development), resilience and action on short-term and long-term environmental change and sustainable cities and communities (both Sustainable Economies and Societies). CATALYST also contributes to a number of the Sustainable Development Goals, most notably SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) andSDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Our secondary objective is to develop an international inter-disciplinary community focused on socio-environmental resilience and we welcome those who wish to engage with our work. Finally, we are looking to boost the capacity of those involved in CATALYST to contribute to future research agendas through supporting their ability to engage in substantive collaborative research projects",
        "wivive-des-1": "This work package takes an interdisciplinary approach to explore the risk posed by HABs, examining the blooms as an opportunity, highlighting the role of algae as a part of the circular economy. Nutrient pathways from source to receptors will be investigated using both traditional and less conventional digital systems, while ecological processes under various management scenarios will be considered. Eutrophication and HABs are global challenge affecting many countries around the world with impacts on different scales. In order to be able to identify local impacts, this work package uses a case study site and community as a test site. HaLong Bay, in the North of Vietnam, which includes scatter of islands and was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1994, is the selected test site. The bay is the main tourism hub in Northern Vietnam. The site and community are involved in a range of activities, including aquaculture and tourism, which are affected by HAB (Nguyen VN et al. 2014).",

        "who-vive":"MAIN ACTIVITIES",
        "who-vive-des":"The main activity will be conceptualising multi-disciplinary source-pathway-receptor linkages of harmful algal blooms (HABs) considering the circular economy and the potential impact on coastal biodiversity and ecology, economy and societal welfare and wellbeing. This will include engagement with other researchers across the University to strengthen the interdisciplinary team and to extend the expertise of the applicants. The team will engage with relevant research centres and URIs across the university, particularly Water and Sustainable Places URIs, and will establish a Special Interests Working Group to ensure inclusion of all interested researchers. The catalyst will engage with the larger national and international community to promote the catalyst and ensure future collaborations as well as filling potential gaps in expertise. This will in part be achieved through the Special Interest Group membership extended outside of the University. Moreover, further engagement, with various stakeholders, including public, local and central authorities, and academics, will be conducted in Vietnam in order to acquire better understanding of the various aspects of the challenge and required deliverable to facilitate evidence-based management solutions. In this work package, we will focus on the eutrophication processes in the HaLong Bay area of Vietnam. The longer term aims of the group are to develop a holistic understanding of the multiple causes of eutrophication and the resulting impacts on receptors (including ecosystem and human health; human, regional, national and international economics) with a view to the development of a framework model for optimal management of this issue wherever it may arise. The framework model will consider different resilient solutions such as using algae as part of the circular economy while considering impacts of such solutions on environment, ecology, ecosystem services, and local economy, social welfare and wellbeing and governance",

This involves working closely with and within Water Companies to listen to their needs concerning water quality issues linked with biological causes, especially cyanobacteria. I have spent time seconded to the Welsh water and worked as their Catchment Limnologist and still work closely with them on the widespread global issue of poor water quality linked to cyanobacterial metabolites (MIB and geosmin) which cause poor Taste and Odour (T&O) supplied to customers or resulting in expensive treatment costs. My main collaborations concern drinking water reservoir management working closely with the water supply industry, but am also interested in other areas of microalgal research including biotechnology, coastal eutrophication and cold climate marine productivity. I have published over 60 international journal articles (H factor 30, over 3000 citations).",
