        "wivive-des": "This work package takes an interdisciplinary approach to explore the risk posed by HABs, examining the blooms as an opportunity, highlighting the role of algae as a part of the circular economy. Nutrient pathways from source to receptors will be investigated using both traditional and less conventional digital systems, while ecological processes under various management scenarios will be considered. Eutrophication and HABs are global challenge affecting many countries around the world with impacts on different scales. In order to be able to identify local impacts, this work package uses a case study site and community as a test site. HaLong Bay, in the North of Vietnam, which includes scatter of islands and was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1994, is the selected test site. The bay is the main tourism hub in Northern Vietnam. The site and community are involved in a range of activities, including aquaculture and tourism, which are affected by HAB (Nguyen VN et al. 2014).",

        "who-vive-des":"The main activity will be conceptualising multi-disciplinary source-pathway-receptor linkages of harmful algal blooms (HABs) considering the circular economy and the potential impact on coastal biodiversity and ecology, economy and societal welfare and wellbeing. This will include engagement with other researchers across the University to strengthen the interdisciplinary team and to extend the expertise of the applicants. The team will engage with relevant research centres and URIs across the university, particularly Water and Sustainable Places URIs, and will establish a Special Interests Working Group to ensure inclusion of all interested researchers. The catalyst will engage with the larger national and international community to promote the catalyst and ensure future collaborations as well as filling potential gaps in expertise. This will in part be achieved through the Special Interest Group membership extended outside of the University. Moreover, further engagement, with various stakeholders, including public, local and central authorities, and academics, will be conducted in Vietnam in order to acquire better understanding of the various aspects of the challenge and required deliverable to facilitate evidence-based management solutions. In this work package, we will focus on the eutrophication processes in the HaLong Bay area of Vietnam. The longer term aims of the group are to develop a holistic understanding of the multiple causes of eutrophication and the resulting impacts on receptors (including ecosystem and human health; human, regional, national and international economics) with a view to the development of a framework model for optimal management of this issue wherever it may arise. The framework model will consider different resilient solutions such as using algae as part of the circular economy while considering impacts of such solutions on environment, ecology, ecosystem services, and local economy, social welfare and wellbeing and governance",
